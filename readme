How to compile server file: gcc server.c -pthread
Execute: ./a.out

How to compile client file: gcc client.c -pthread
Execute: ./a.out

Server needs to be run on cse01.cse.unt.edu machine. 
Clients can be run in any UNT machines.

How it works: Clients can type any messages in both capitalized and lowercased. 
Server will process the message, count number of words, characters, vowels 
and send back the procceed messages to clients. 
New message will be all in lower case; number of words, characters and vowels 
will also be displayed on client's screen.

If not used, client can quit by typing "quit"
